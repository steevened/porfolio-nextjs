        "description": "Para Cuando is a platform for people in Queretaro, Mexico to vote on their favorite events in three categories: 'artistas y conciertos', 'marcas y tiendas', and 'torneos'. Users can browse events as guests, but must register to vote. Once registered, users can vote on events, post their own events, and see their voting history. The platform also allows users to set their favorite categories and profile picture. The project was built using TypeScript, NextJS, TailwindCSS, Formik, and SWR, with data from a third-party API provided by the backend team. I led the frontend team and was responsible for the majority of the development work.",
