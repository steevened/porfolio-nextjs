          As a passionate front-end developer, I create amazing websites and web
          apps to make the internet a better place.

          I am 22 years old and ever since I was a kid, I&apos;ve been
          fascinated by computers and how they work. I used to spend hours
          tinkering with hardware and software, trying to understand how
          everything fit together. Today, I use that same curiosity and
          enthusiasm to build websites that are not only visually stunning, but
          also easy to navigate and intuitive to use. When I&apos;m not coding,
          you can find me exploring new places, walking with my pets, reading a
          good book or capturing the world through my camera lens.

        Growing up in Ecuador has been a significant influence on who I am
        today. The vibrant culture, stunning landscapes, and friendly people
        have shaped my worldview and my values. Living here has taught me to
        appreciate the small things in life, like spending time with loved ones,
        savoring delicious food, and enjoying the beauty of nature. I am
        grateful for the experiences and opportunities that my home country has
        given me, and I look forward to continuing to explore all that it has to
        offer.
